  <p>The old adage of power in numbers should not be downplayed when it comes to Berlin-based multidisciplinary project Slow Life. Made up of producer S. Moreira, a cast of diggers Cecilio, Dj Tree, and Laurine, and designer Santi Uribe, Slow Life’s magnetizing appeal is one drawn from the sum of its parts. The grounded success of the crew, too, can be charted to its one for all mentality; an ethos that places the project’s steady growth ahead of any personal fame—they’ve simply let their music and curation reach audiences in an organic way, resulting in a fan base that recognizes the quality in their meticulously sown output and hard-earned skills.op:40px;">My Own Jupiter is a multimedia invitation onto the planet Edurne and Nicolas Lutz have created for themselves. It is the ticket onto the ship of imagination, the oxygen tank to better help us breathe in the glimmering fumes of a planet that we may not belong to—but are certainly welcome to explore.
